# Reinforcement Learning Course Notes

Welcome! This repository contains my notes, code, and resources from the **Reinforcement Learning** course offered by DataCamp. I will be uploading content as I progress through the course, including key concepts, code snippets, and project work.

## About the Course

The DataCamp Reinforcement Learning course introduces the fundamentals of reinforcement learning (RL), a branch of machine learning where agents learn to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The course covers:

Topics Covered:
🧠 Core Concepts: Agents, environments, rewards, states, and policies

🔁 Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)

📈 Value-Based Methods: Q-learning and temporal difference learning

🎯 Policy-Based Methods: Policy gradients and actor-critic methods

🎲 Exploration vs. Exploitation

🛠 Practical Implementations using Python and popular libraries

Prerequisites: Basic understanding of Python and foundational machine learning concepts is recommended.

This course is suitable for learners with a basic understanding of Python and machine learning.
